      "description": "For a less finicky fern option, go with the bird's nest fern. This one has thick, glossy leaves that hold onto moisture and humidity longer than many other types of ferns—making it the least fussy of its kind. Give it bright indirect light, and water it only when the top few inches of soil feel dry."

Be sure to give this plant lots of bright indirect light and water every few weeks when it's totally dry. It's easy to overwater, so check the soil first to avoid root rot."

      "description": "The lush foliage of this plant (Phlebodium aureum) prefers medium to bright indirect light, plenty of mist and humidity, and occasional watering. Because its full, feather-like leaves get longer as they grow, it looks best in a hanging planter."

      "description": "The only thing that levels the Boston fern up from easy is its love of steam. Because it thrives in low light and humidity, it makes a great bathroom plant. Hang it in a corner, allowing its dark green fronds to drape down, and water it regularly—but only once the soil has completely dried out."
